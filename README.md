Certainly! Portfolio optimization is a financial strategy similar to putting together a puzzle. In this puzzle, each investment is a piece, and you want to arrange them in a way that helps you earn the most money while managing the risk you're comfortable with. It's like finding puzzle pieces that not only complete the picture but also fit together to create a balanced, profitable portfolio. You want to strike the right balance between risk and return, just as you'd aim for the perfect balance between challenge and enjoyment in solving a puzzle.

## üòáMotivation
Portfolio management can be a complex and time-consuming task, especially for those without extensive financial expertise. The goal of building this portfolio optimizer is to simplify the investment process and make it more efficient for all individuals, regardless of their financial background. This tool is designed to empower people to take charge of their financial future with confidence and ease. By optimizing portfolios, we aim to provide a straightforward way for anyone to make informed and strategic investment decisions, ultimately working towards their financial goals.
## ‚ö†Ô∏èTech Stack
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
- Markowitz model
- Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) 

## ‚≠ê Features
- Leveraging advanced techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models showcases a commitment to cutting-edge predictive analytics, ensuring robust and accurate forecasting capabilities.
- Utilizing a decade-spanning dataset, with distinct phases for training, testing, and forecasting, ensures thorough analysis of historical stock data, leading to more informed predictions and insights.
- By integrating SVM and ARIMA models, your project adopts a holistic approach to analyzing stock movements, harnessing the strengths of both techniques to uncover intricate patterns and dependencies within the data.
- The incorporation of Harry Markowitz's foundational principles and the consideration of transaction costs in portfolio construction demonstrate a focus on real-world applicability, providing practical solutions for investors seeking to balance risk and return in their portfolios.
- The simulated investment scenario and comparative analysis with Markowitz portfolios offer valuable insights into the efficacy of predictive analytics in investment decision-making, highlighting both the strengths and limitations of relying solely on machine learning models for portfolio management.
## üìÇ Data Sets


For this project, we strategically selected stocks from three major sectors: Technology, Food, and Banking/Financial. Each sector was represented by two prominent companies to ensure a diversified and representative dataset.

In the Technology sector, we chose Apple and Nvidia. Apple, a global leader in consumer electronics, and Nvidia, renowned for its contributions to artificial intelligence and graphics technology, represent key players in this innovative field.

For the Food sector, Coca-Cola and Unilever were selected. Coca-Cola, an iconic brand in the beverage industry, and Unilever, boasting a vast portfolio of food and personal care brands, were chosen for their consistent market presence and innovation.

In the Banking/Financial sector, Bank of America and American Express were identified. Bank of America, one of the largest banks in the United States, and American Express, a leading credit card network and financial services company, were selected for their significant impact and presence in the financial industry.

This selection of companies from each sector ensures a comprehensive representation of diverse industries, allowing for thorough analysis and insights into the broader dynamics of the stock market.

Historical data spanning from 2010 to 2020 was meticulously collected for these stocks from reputable financial data providers. A significant portion of the data was sourced from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library, which offers a reliable interface for accessing historical stock prices, trading volumes, and other financial metrics.
